==========

Xustom Home (pronounced "custom") is an open source, low power, highly affordable, highly customizable system for connecting and automating the home. Using passive or active triggers, homeowners can make use of popular services like AT&amp;T Digital Life, M2X Flow Designer, IBM BlueMix and thousands of web services to create custom schedules and IFTTT ("If This Then That") style connections for their home appliances and devices.  This customization makes it easier for homeowners to control their energy consumption while creating useful cases of real world interaction with the cloud in the home.
